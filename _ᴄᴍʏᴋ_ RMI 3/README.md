# █▓▒░ CMYK ♦ RMI ♦ TRIPLE ░▒▓█ 
## ◊ Introduction 
This script makes use of three RMI's, that indicate Overbought/Oversold on different timescales that correspond with Frequency’s that move the market. 

## ◊ Origin 
The Relative Momentum Index was developed by Roger Altman and was introduced in his article in the February, 1993 issue of Technical Analysis of Stocks & Commodities magazine. 
While RSI counts up and down ticks from close to close, the Relative Momentum Index counts up and down ticks from the close relative to a close x number of days ago. 
This results in an RSI that is smoother, and has another setting for fine tuning results. 

This bot originated out of Project XIAM, an investigative script that outlined my approach towards Automated Trading Strategies.
